To build the program I have used Python 3.9

I assumed that input file will be paste into directory 'kamil.wawrzak'

To start the program please command inside 'kamil.wawrzak' directory:

python main.py

Result file should appear in 'kamil.wawrzak' directory.

In order to run tests please use command inside 'kamil.wawrzak' diectory:

pytest
